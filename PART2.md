## Problems Encountered & Solutions

P: At the beginning, we did not know what to do at all.

S: We assummed that this assignment is a combination of all lab tutorials. So we studied them and we got where we are right now.


P: It was hard to share progress between team members. And we are still confused with GitHub.

S: We decided to use codeshare.io because it is easier.


P: system("pause") does not work in VS Code.

S: We learned how to make a mypause() function using cin.clear,sync,get() as an alternative.


P: Save and Load were the most challenging thing to program.

S: Online resources helped a lot.
